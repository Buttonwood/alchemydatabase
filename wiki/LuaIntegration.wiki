= AlchemyDB's Lua Integration =

Lua has been integrated into AlchemyDB in basically every way that made sense for an important use case. The following is a list of how and where and maybe even why it was integrated

  # ==INTERRET LUAFILE filename==
Load a file full of lua into AlchemyDB's lua universe, and it will be interpreted to byte-code (or if LuaJIT is installed, parts of it _may_ be turned into machine-code).

  # == INTERPRET LUA "lua-lua-lua-lua" ==
Load a line of Lua into AlchemyDB's lua universe, and it will be interpreted to byte-code (or if LuaJIT is installed, parts of it _may_ be turned into machine-code).

  # == LUAFUNC functionname args ==
Once you have interpreted some Lua, you need to be able to call it from your client and have its return value returned to your client

  # == LUA CRON ==
AlchemyDB has a config file setting to run a lua function every 100ms. Usage can be handy, but is discouraged, because the function BLOCKS.

  # == LUATRIGGER ==
Similar to a RDBMS trigger, Alchemy will call a lua function when you INSERT,DELETE,UPDATE a SQL row and pass this function the contents of the row.
